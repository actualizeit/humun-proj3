### Onboarding

After answering some basic questions about your values, you will be paired with charities in different impact areas that match your priorities.

Charities are vetted for efficicacy and will be updated over time if either more effective charities, or charities that better match your prioirities, are added.

If there is an organization you would particularly like to support, you can also select a specific charity to donate to alongside the recommended charities.
